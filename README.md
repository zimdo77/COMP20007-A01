# COMP20007-A01 (Grade 10/10)
- Code for Assignment 1 for UniMelb subject: [Design of Algorithms (COMP20007)](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/comp20007) - Semester 1, 2024.
- Skeleton code written by subject tutors; implemented by me.
- Assignment specification in the pdf attached.
- Compile using Makefile, and run using, e.g., "./problem1a < test_cases/1a-1.txt".

## Main tasks
- Implement algorithms to compute the convex hull of a set of points - implemented a doubly linked list.
- Implement algorithms to solve graph problems (BFS, Prim, Dijkstra).
